# Hi there, Seven here! 👋

I am a Sustainable Product Manager.  I love building stuff. In 5 years, my goal is to build my own treehouse facing the river that flows behind my home and... build more cool stuff. 


## Sustainable.. what now? 

Well, it's complicated. 

**Take a problem statement:**
Drinking coffee on a ceramic cup, while inside an air-conditioned room... is not ideal. Hot liquids are lighter and rise to the top of the cup, keeping the upper layer warm, while the coffee below goes cold.

**How can I fix this?**
As a Product Manager, my goal is to make something that eliminates the problem while generating revenue. 

-- I can go ahead and experiment with materials that transfer heat equally from the sides so that the coffee cools evenly. 
-- I can invent a lid that reduces the heat loss from the surface so that the coffee stays evenly warm. 

As a Sustainable Product Manager, my goal is to eliminate the problem and generate revenue by providing a solution, while ensuring the solution does not eliminate something good on the way before we can measure the true consequences of the change. 

-- So, I would make a stirrer that can go with an existing ceramic cup. You clean the stirrer with the cup, and store it with the cup. 

Not a groundbreaking invention. Not flashy. But something that works. 


# What am I working on? 

1. A Natural Pond: I am planning to build a natural pond near the river I was talking about. This is still something I am working on and a work in progress. 
2. Kickboxing Degree: I am a Diploma holder in Japanese Kick Boxing. I am working towards my Degree. I am not exceptional at the sport, but I am consistent and I show up. 
3. PM7: It is my attempt to offload the most mundane tasks in Product Management to someone more capable than yourself, while you can concentrate on what needs to be built.
